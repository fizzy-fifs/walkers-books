Possible UI/UX Improvements:

- Improve spacing & typography: consistent scale, tighter card layouts, and a single set of CSS tokens for colors/spacing.
- Modal polish: add subtle open/close transitions, focus trap, and return focus to the triggering control on close.
- Inline validation: show field-level validation and remaining character counts; use clear, user-friendly messages.
- Responsive list: ensure list items compress cleanly on mobile and add a compact layout for small screens.
- Action feedback: show loading states and success toasts for add/edit/delete actions; disable controls while saving.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation for sidebar and modals, ARIA labels for icon buttons, and color-contrast checks.

These are small, high-ROI changes that make the app feel more polished and usable.
